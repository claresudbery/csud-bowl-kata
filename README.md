# Csud::Bowl::Kata

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/csud/bowl/kata`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

This is based on my original [bowling kata code](https://github.com/claresudbery/bowling-kata-ruby).

The kata is described [here](https://learn.madetech.com/katas/bowling).

I am following [this tutorial](https://learn.madetech.com/guides/06-Gem-Packaging/) for creating a Ruby gem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'csud-bowl-kata'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install csud-bowl-kata

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
